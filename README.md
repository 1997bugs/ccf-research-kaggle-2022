# Segmenting functional tissue units across human organs using community-driven development of generalizable machine learning algorithms

The development of a [reference atlas of the healthy human body at the single-cell resolution](https://hubmapconsortium.org/) requires the segmentation of major anatomical structures which poses a challenge due to the massive amounts of data that needs to be integrated and analyzed. To accelerate progress, efficient machine learning algorithms are needed that can segment structures such as functional tissue units (FTUs) in histological images across different organs. This paper outlines the plan to conduct a global challenge on Google’s ML community platform, Kaggle, that will focus on the development of machine learning algorithms that are generalizable across organs and robust across dataset differences to segment functional tissue units (FTUs). We detail the competition setup, evaluation metrics, prizes, and will present and compare the winning algorithms and machine learning results.

The repo is structured in the following way:
```
├── utils
```
## Data

All data will be made publicly available after competition end (September 2022). 

## Models

All machine learning models (baseline model, winning algorithms) will be made publicly available after competition end (September 2022).
